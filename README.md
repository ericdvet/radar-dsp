# radar-dsp

Digital notebook of my mini-projects as I navigate Fundamentals of Radar Signal Processing by Mark A. Richards.

You will find each project in the /projects directory.

## simple_pulsed_radar_system
This project sees the simulation of a basic pulsed radar system.

## sampling_quantization
This project sees the simulation of how different sampling frequencies affect the signal spectrum.

## ambiguity_function
This project sees the ambiguity function of various waveforms, and some analysis.
