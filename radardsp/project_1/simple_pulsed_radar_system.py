This project sees the simulation of a basic pulsed radar system. The goals are:
    - Implement a simple monostatic radar model with a single target at a fixed
        range.
    - Generate a pulsed radar waveform (rectangular pulse first.)
    - Propagate it to the target and back with a delay corresponding to the
        target's range.
    - Add noise to simulate an Additive White Gaussian Noise channel.
    - Plot the received signal and demonstrate how range can be extracted by
        measuring the delay.

Concepts used: signal models, time delay, range equation.
